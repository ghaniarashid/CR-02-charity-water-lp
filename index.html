    <h1>TURN PASSION INTO IMPACT. HELP BRING CLEAN WATER TO COMMUNITIES IN NEED.</h1>
    <p>
      Charity: water gives people the power to make a real difference by financing safe and clean
      drinking water projects around the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      As 100 percent of public donations are utilized directly in the field, the donors themselves
      get to witness the real impact of their donations. This changes lives, saves futures, and constructs
      permanent change.
